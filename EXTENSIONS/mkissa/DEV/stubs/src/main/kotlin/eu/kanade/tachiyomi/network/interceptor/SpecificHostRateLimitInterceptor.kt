/**
 * An OkHttp interceptor that handles given url host's rate limiting.
 *
 * This uses Java Time APIs and is the legacy method, kept
 * for compatibility reasons with existing extensions.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * httpUrl = "https://api.anime.com".toHttpUrl(), permits = 5, period = 1, unit = seconds  =>  5 requests per second to api.anime.com
 * httpUrl = "https://cdn.thumbnails.com".toHttpUrl(), permits = 10, period = 2, unit = minutes  =>  10 requests per 2 minutes to cdn.thumbnails.com
 *
 * @since extension-lib 13
 *
 * @param httpUrl [HttpUrl] The url host that this interceptor should handle. Will get url's host by using HttpUrl.host()
 * @param permits [Int]     Number of requests allowed within a period of units.
 * @param period [Long]     The limiting duration. Defaults to 1.
 * @param unit [TimeUnit]   The unit of time for the period. Defaults to seconds.
